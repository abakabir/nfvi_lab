  # You can exclude overcloud nodes from receiving an updated deployment.
  # This is useful in scenarios where you aim to scale new node while excluding
  # existing nodes from receiving an updated set of parameters and resources from the core Heat template collection. 

  # WARNING #

  # It is possible create a hung stack or configure the overcloud incorrectly using the blacklist feature.
  # For example, if a cluster configuration changes applies to all members of a Pacemaker cluster, blacklisting a Pacemaker cluster member during this change can cause the cluster to fail.

  # Do not use the blacklist during update or upgrade procedures.
  # Those procedures have their own methods for isolating changes to particular servers.

  # When adding servers to the blacklist, further changes to those nodes are not supported until the server is removed from the blacklist.

  # NEVER blacklist the OpenStack Controller when Ceph is deployed by TripleO as the Stack Update will fail!
